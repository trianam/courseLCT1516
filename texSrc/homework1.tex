The owner of a clothes shop wants to apply a discount, during a sale,
based on the 
total cost of the goods that the client buy. The applied discount must
be:
\begin{itemize}
\item 0\% if the total amount is less than 10\euro;
\item 10\% if the total amount is between 10\euro{} and 50\euro;
\item 25\% if the total amount is more than 50\euro.
\end{itemize}

Make a program that, given the total amount of the sold items, returns
the final price with the possible discount applied.

\paragraph{Tip} Remember that, in flow charts, selections have only a binary
condition inside and two exits.
