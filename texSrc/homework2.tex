In Italy physical people pay taxes proportionally to their annual
incomes. Each person is in a certain income
class and pays a certain percent of the income as taxes.
the income class and the relative taxes are expressed in the table:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    Income class&Class range&Quote for the class&Tax\\
    \hline
    \hline
    1&0\euro{} - 15000\euro&23\%&23\% of income\\
    \hline
    2&15000.01\euro{} - 28000\euro&27\%&3450\euro{} + 27\% of the
    excess from 15000\euro\\
    \hline
    3&28000.01\euro{} - 55000\euro&38\%&6960\euro{} + 38\% of the
    excess from 28000\euro\\
    \hline
    4&55000.01\euro{} - 75000\euro&41\%&17220\euro{} + 41\% of the
    excess from 55000\euro\\
    \hline
    5&more than 75000\euro&43\%&25420\euro{} + 43\% of the
    excess from 75000\euro\\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

For instance if you earn 10000\euro{} you are in the 1$^{th}$ class,
and you pay on taxes:
$$
\frac{10000}{100}\cdot 23,
$$
if you earn 30500\euro{} you are in the 3$^{th}$ class,
and you pay on taxes:
$$
6960+\frac{30500-28000}{100}\cdot 38,
$$
if you earn 100000\euro{} you are in the 5$^{th}$ class,
and you pay on taxes:
$$
25420+\frac{100000-75000}{100}\cdot 43.
$$

Write a program that calculate how much you need to pay in
taxes, given your income in input.
