A farmer owns a number of rabbits, and he wants to know how many rabbits he will have in an amount of
months. We can simplify the reproduction rule assuming that each
couple of rabbits make 5 babies each month, so in a month the total
population of rabbits increase by a factor of $5/2=2.5$.

I.e. if the
initial population is $n$, after 1 month the population will be
$n+n*2.5$

Make a program that let the farmer calculate the rabbits population
after a number $m$ of months and with an initial population $n$ of
rabbits.
