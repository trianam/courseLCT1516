According to the CIA World Factbook the current world annual growth
rate is $1.096\%$, this mean that in 1 year the world population
increase by a factor $0.01096$.

I.e. if today the number of people is $p$, in a year will be about
$p+p\cdot 0.01096$.

Make a program that let you forecast the world population after a
number $y$ of years from now, having a number of people $p$ today.
